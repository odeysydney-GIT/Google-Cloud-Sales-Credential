# Google-Cloud-Sales-Credential
GCP Sales Authentication Demo: This project provides a practical guide and code repository for authenticating to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for sales-related applications and workflows. The repository demonstrates three common and secure methods for authenticating to GCP, each with a corresponding Python script.

  - <b>AUTHENTICATION FUNCTIONS:</b>

This contains the core functions for authentication. It demonstrates the three methods. 
import os
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from google.auth import default

def authenticate_with_service_account_key(key_file_path):
    """Authenticates using a service account key file."""
    try:
        credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(key_file_path)
        print("‚úÖ Authenticated successfully with Service Account Key.")
        return credentials
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Failed to authenticate with Service Account Key: {e}")
        return None

def authenticate_with_adc():
    """Authenticates using Application Default Credentials (ADC)."""
    try:
        credentials, project = default()
        if credentials.valid and credentials.token:
            print(f"‚úÖ Authenticated successfully with ADC. Project: {project}")
            return credentials
        else:
            # Refresh if token has expired
            credentials.refresh(Request())
            print(f"‚úÖ Authenticated successfully with ADC (refreshed).")
            return credentials
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Failed to authenticate with ADC: {e}")
        return None


# This function demonstrates how to use the credentials once the action provides them.
def authenticate_with_workload_identity():
    """Authenticates using Workload Identity Federation (assumes credentials are set by the environment)."""
    try:
        credentials, project = default()
        print(f"‚úÖ Authenticated successfully with Workload Identity. Project: {project}")
        return credentials
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Failed to authenticate with Workload Identity: {e}")
        print("Hint: This method requires a specific environment setup (e.g., GitHub Actions).")
        return None

  - <b>MAIN SCRIPT TO RUN DEMO:</b>

       This script uses the authentication functions to perform a simple task, like listing your Google Cloud projects. This provides a tangible demonstration of successful authentication.

    import authenticate
from google.api_core.exceptions import GoogleAPIError
from google.cloud import resourcemanager_v3
import google.api_core.client_options as client_options

def list_gcp_projects(credentials):
    """Lists all Google Cloud projects accessible with the given credentials."""
    if not credentials:
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è No valid credentials provided. Cannot list projects.")
        return

    try:
        # Use the Resource Manager V3 API to list projects
        client = resourcemanager_v3.ProjectsClient(
            credentials=credentials,
            client_options=client_options.ClientOptions(api_endpoint="https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com")
        )

        print("üîé Listing projects...")
        request = resourcemanager_v3.ListProjectsRequest(parent="organizations/YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID") # Replace with your organization ID or leave empty to list all projects accessible to the user/service account
        
        page_iterator = client.list_projects(request=request)
        
        for project in page_iterator:
            print(f"   - Project: {project.display_name} ({project.project_id})")
        
        print("‚úÖ Project listing complete.")

    except GoogleAPIError as e:
        print(f"‚ùå An API error occurred: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

    print("\n--- Running Demo: Service Account Key ---")
    key_file_path = "path/to/your/key.json"
    sa_credentials = authenticate.authenticate_with_service_account_key(key_file_path)

    # This won't work locally without the proper environment variables,
    # but the code is here to show the concept. It's meant to be used in
    # a GitHub Actions workflow.
